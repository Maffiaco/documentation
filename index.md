  Edit payment form with disabled type. To change type, we must delete the old payment to create new payment with different type.

  Amending payment shown different amount with reason.
  i.e. this case, order are paid fully `11.405.237 ‚Ç´`, then editted to `10.000.000 ‚Ç´`. We'll record an amending refund payment of `1.405.237 ‚Ç´`.
