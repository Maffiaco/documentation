When opening 2 tabs on the "Edit Order" page:
- User in Tab 1 submits an item, then user in Tab 2 submits an item.
- The items submitted by user 1 will not be saved in the action of user 2 and will become empty names when sent to KDS.

Solution:
Get all items before submitting and attach them to the payload along with the newly added items.
