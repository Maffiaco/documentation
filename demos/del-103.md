### [QH] [DELIANY-1982](https://deliany.youtrack.cloud/issue/DELIANY-1982/Bug-Not-show-product-name-in-order-slip-KDS-when-sending-from-many-tabs-POS) Not show product name in order slip KDS when sending from many tabs POS
When opening 2 tabs on the "Edit Order" page:
- User in Tab 1 submits an item, then user in Tab 2 submits an item.
- The items submitted by user 1 will not be saved in the action of user 2 and will become empty names when sent to KDS.

Solution:
Get all items before submitting and attach them to the payload along with the newly added items.
