### [QH] ðŸš€ Do not display empty categories

- Issue:
  - We created a mapping of productId to hidden to check the display of products.
  - Then, we render all products within the outlet categories.
  - We check if all products within a category are hidden, and if so, we hide the entire category.
  - This leads to a situation where the initial category, which contained products not in the outlet, was not checked.
  - As a result, the category remains visible, even though it's empty after being filtered by the mapping array.
- Solution: Add a filter to only render products that are in the productOutlet mapping and check for hidden status.

### [QH] [DELIANY-2616](https://deliany.youtrack.cloud/issue/DELIANY-2616) [Bug][POS] System prints drawer order page instead of customer bill when user clicks print on iPad using Chrome

- Issue: Chromium on the Chrome browser for iOS/iPadOS operating systems, when using the print element, only triggers the window print.
- Solution: When Chrome on iOS is detected, open a window to display the bill and print from that window.

### [QH][POS] Order listing improvements

- Migrate to `Ant Design`.
- Change `Select` to `DatePicker`.
- Optimize data requests and re-rendering.
- Add necessary new information to the `Table` according to the new design.

**Issue**: Need to add Queue TV Display management feature for merchants to create and manage TV screens that display order queue information at service locations.

**Resolve**: Implemented complete CRUD operations with GraphQL schema, React components for TV management (create/edit forms with preview), display settings configuration (Order Type, Customer Name, 
Order Code), and Vietnamese text-to-URL conversion utilities.
