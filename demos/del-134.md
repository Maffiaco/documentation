### [Nam] [WIP][DELIANY-2626](https://deliany.youtrack.cloud/issue/DELIANY-2626) Provide a solution for user to create shortcut to app

The major purpose is to allow for smooth, uninterrupted printing without requiring a confirmation dialog each time a print action is performed.

- **Expectation**: Give users a button that allows them to quickly establish a shortcut to the app on their device.
- **Suggested solution**: Use Google Chrome's `kiosk` mode, which can bypass the native print confirmation window, providing a more smooth printing experience.
- **Proposed implementation**: Create a lightweight Electron-based wrapper for our web application.  Users can download and install (or execute directly) this standalone application, which functions as a dedicated client, allowing for shortcut creation and optimized printing behavior.

#### Pros

- Quick and easy installation: Users may download and set up the app with little effort.
- Cross-platform compatibility: Electron enables us to create and distribute binaries for several operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux) with a single codebase.
- Deeper system access: The app can interact with native system capabilities more directly than a browser-based app, frequently without the need for cumbersome permission workflows â€“ for example, accessing the camera, microphone, speakers, and so on.
- Bypass browser limitations: Using Electron, we can avoid browser-imposed constraints such as print dialogs, giving us more control over the user experience.
- Supports auto-launch and desktop integrations: We may include native features such as auto-start on boot, system tray, and desktop notifications.

#### Cons/Areas for Improvement

- Installation is required: Users must install the app locally, which may cause friction for some.  The size is pretty large - approximately 260MB on MacOS.
- Code signing requirements: To enable features such as auto-updates or update notifications on macOS, the app must be signed, which necessitates additional setup (Apple Developer account, certificate management, CI/CD signing, etc.).
- Electron programs are noted for being resource-intensive, as they include Chromium and Node.js, which can consume more RAM and CPU than native counterparts.
- Security considerations: Because we are bundling online content in a desktop shell, we must take extra precautions to sandbox untrusted input and avoid security concerns such as remote code execution or privilege escalation.
