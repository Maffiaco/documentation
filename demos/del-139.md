### [Nam] ðŸš€ Slightly improved searching with full-text search

Enable accent-insensitive search across content â€” users can now search without needing to type accents on characters, making search more natural and user-friendly.

- Enabled PostgreSQLâ€™s `unaccent` extension to strip diacritics at query time.
- Search now matches results regardless of Vietnamese accents (e.g., searching `ca phe` will match both `cÃ  phÃª` and `ca phe sua da`).

#### Implementation Strategy

Instead of always imposing unaccented matches, we can favor exact accent-sensitive matches when they are available and gently fall back to unaccented matches if none are discovered.

**1. Mechanisms for scoring and ranking**

Assign a score to each potential matched token:

- `1.0` â†’ Exact match (accent-sensitive)
- `0.5` â†’ Unaccented match only

**2. Use full-text search with rankings**

- ~Create `tsvector` columns with both original and unaccented content~
- Use `ts_rank_cd()` to compute relevance
- Prefer accurate phrase matches (with accent) in **lexeme** weighting
