## Sprint DEL-139

### [QH] ðŸš€ [DELIANY-2806](https://deliany.youtrack.cloud/issue/DELIANY-2806) Some inventory items show quantity 0 in the Receipt Summary after being added

- Issue: The issue occurs when validating the `quantity` from `inventorySupplier`. If a quantity is provided, that value will be used instead of defaulting to 1.
- Solution: It starts at 1 when an item is added.

### [QH] ðŸš€ [DELIANY-2828](https://deliany.youtrack.cloud/issue/DELIANY-2828) Updates on Location are not displayed correctly

- Issue: When navigating from the location details to the edit page, performing an update, and then returning. The details drawer remains open, causing outdated location information to be displayed.
- Solution: Unmount the details drawer when exiting the page.

### [QH] [DELIANY-2770](https://deliany.youtrack.cloud/issue/DELIANY-2770) Addition groups display radio buttons instead of checkboxes on mobile devices/responsive view

### [QH] [DELIANY-2817](https://deliany.youtrack.cloud/issue/DELIANY-2817) Some product add buttons disabled on location page

- Issue: The issue is caused by the product's status on the `productOutlet` table being in a `deactivated` state.
- Solution:
  - 1: Modify the values in the `productOutlet` table to ensure the item functions normally.
  - 2: Entails deleting this check logic, as it's part of the migration to a service location.
  - 3: Allowing Managers to control product status on the POS.

### [QH] [DELIANY-2865](https://deliany.youtrack.cloud/issue/DELIANY-2865) Display incorrect recipient information in Delivery Order Edit Page (new ver.)

- Issue: The issue stems from the recipient value being overwritten after retrieving the results from the contact information request.
- Solution: Do not overwrite if a previous value exists. If related information is changed, clear the value for consistent retrieval and writing.

### [Nam] ðŸš€ Slightly improved searching with full-text search

Enable accent-insensitive search across content â€” users can now search without needing to type accents on characters, making search more natural and user-friendly.

- Enabled PostgreSQLâ€™s `unaccent` extension to strip diacritics at query time.
- Search now matches results regardless of Vietnamese accents (e.g., searching `ca phe` will match both `cÃ  phÃª` and `ca phe sua da`).

#### Implementation Strategy

Instead of always imposing unaccented matches, we can favor exact accent-sensitive matches when they are available and gently fall back to unaccented matches if none are discovered.

**1. Mechanisms for scoring and ranking**

Assign a score to each potential matched token:

- `1.0` â†’ Exact match (accent-sensitive)
- `0.5` â†’ Unaccented match only

**2. Use full-text search with rankings**

- ~Create `tsvector` columns with both original and unaccented content~
- Use `ts_rank_cd()` to compute relevance
- Prefer accurate phrase matches (with accent) in **lexeme** weighting
